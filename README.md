teleportd
=========

Just playing around a bit with teleportd and sinatra



Startup
=======

Edit teleport_me.rb and put in you API-token/user_key where it reads 'YOURTOKENHERE'

Start the server with
    ruby -rubygems teleport_me.rb

That should get you a working sintra app listening on

http://localhost:4567
