teleportd
=========

Just havin' fun playing around a bit with teleportd, and sinatra.

Startup
=======

Create a ```config/teleportd.yml``` (there's a sample file to go off) and put in you API-token/user_key.

Start the server with
    bundle install
    rackup

That should get you a working sintra app listening on

[http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292)
